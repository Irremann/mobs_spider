Minetest spiders mod by Irremann

Spiders are not monsters!
Can tame, breed and give a web.
New recipes: creating strings from cobwebs and wool from strings.
Search spiders in caves below 50 meters. Just follow the path from the cobwebs.
They should be tamed with all meat (uncooked), eggs, rats, rabbits, chickens and of course kittens from mod: mobs_animal and mobs.
